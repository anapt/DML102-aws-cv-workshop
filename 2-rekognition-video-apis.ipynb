This Lambda function makes an asynchronous call to the Amazon Rekognition Video face detection API and starts the execution of the AWS Step Functions workflow.\n",

To easily use OpenCV with our Lambda function, we built a Docker image hosted on Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and then deployed on AWS Lambda thanks to Container Image Support."
